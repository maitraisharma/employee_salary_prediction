# Problem Statement
To predict salaries of employees based on various factors given in the dataset

# Data
It is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavanelisetty/salarypredictions

# Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting employee salaries during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project

# Features
The dataset folder contains the following files:

train_dataset.csv = 1000000 x 8

train_salaries.csv = 1000000 x 2

test_dataset.csv = 1000000 x 8
